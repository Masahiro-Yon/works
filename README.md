Operating from Gunma Prefecture, my main professional activity is as a freelance graphic designer. Born in 1979, I graduated from the Graphic Design program, Department of Design, Musashino Art University Junior College. I apply a consistent design approach throughout my process, which spans from photography and direction to data creation. This enables flexible handling of a wide range of print media. I also undertake the creation and exhibition of artistic works. As a member of the Modern Art Association (Gunma Branch), I am currently producing a series of large-scale digital prints that utilize AI. Drawing influence from areas including technology, science, and popular culture, I aim to deliver work characterized by a broad viewpoint and distinctiveness. I maintain a presence on Note where I publish various texts to structure my thinking and record moments of inspiration. Connections are welcome. https://note.com/mshryn
